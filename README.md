## SQL & Data Modelling

The dataset was modelled using a star schema optimised for analytical workloads.
The core fact table represents daily COVID metrics at a country level, supported
by date and country dimensions. In addition to this I:

- Implemented analytical queries and window functions
- Built reusable views for reporting
- Performed data quality validation
- Applied indexing for performance optimisation
